Todo
Design
[x]-input container
[x]-tags and invalid tags
[x]-drop down
Functionality
[x]-mock api
[x]-filter
[x]-email validation
[x]-click tag to edit

Improvements
[]-Having a pop up message to add email to contacts when entering an email that isnt in the dropdown list.
[]-animations, like showing hover state on tags then fading out
[]-current implementaion always filters from All emails, better solution would be to filter from current suggestions.
[x]-I think dropdown styling for autocomplete seems more intuitive the way its currently implemented, rather than moving with the input position.

With More Time
[]-get styling closer to figma
-font
-icons
-overall dropdown styling
[]-file was getting long, would like to refactor and break into smaller components. such as tag and dropdown components.
[]-navigate drop down with arrows and selection with keyboard for better accessability

Todo
Design
[]-input container
[]-tags and invalid tags
[]-drop down
Functionality
[]-mock api
[]-filter
[]-email validation
[]-click tag to edit

Improvements / With More Time
[]-Having a pop up message to add email to contacts when entering an email that isnt in the dropdown list.
[]-show tag then, fade out
[]-current implementaion always filters from All emails, better solution would be to filter from current suggestions.
[]-file was getting long, would like to refactor and break into smaller components. such as tag and dropdown components.

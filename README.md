Improvements / With More Time
[]-Having a pop up message to add email to contacts when entering an email that isnt in the dropdown list.
[]-show tag then, fade out
[]-current implementaion always filters from All emails, better solution would be to filter from current suggestions.
[]-file was getting long, would like to refactor and break into smaller components. such as tag and dropdown components.
